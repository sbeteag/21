21 by Steven Beteag
Last update: 4.30.2017

This is a basic version of Blackjack, inspired by Resident Evil 7.
It has a single, 11-card deck that both you and the computer play from.
Whoever gets closest to 21 without going over wins.
You automatically lose if you go over 21, even if the computer has gone over 21 also.
